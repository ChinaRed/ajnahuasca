      <h1>What does “Ajnahuasca” stand for?</h1>
      <h2>Ajnahuasca is the combination of two terms… Ayahuasca and Ajna Light.</h2>
      <div class="ayahuasca_summary section heading_font">
        <h1>Ayahuasca</h1><p style="text-align: justify;">Ayahuasca is a liquid used by indigenous tribes in the Amazonian jungle to induce “spiritual” experiences. This liquid is generally comprised of two plants… Psychotria Viridis (chacruna) and Banisteriopsis Caapi (B. Caapi). The Psychotria Viridis plant contains the hallucinogenic compound known as DMT (abbreviation for N,N-dimethyltryptamine). The human digestive system contains vast quantities of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase (MAO) which breaks down DMT rapidly rendering it orally inactive. The Banisteriopsis Caapi plant contains monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) which prevents the degradation of DMT allowing it to remain orally active leading to subsequent “hallucinatory” effects for a few hours following ingestion of Ayahuasca.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ayahuasca has been reported to induce a wide range of effects including (but not limited to) transcendental visionary states to measurable changes in brain connectivity (neuroplasticity) to physiological discomfort including vomiting and diarrhea. This shamanic brew is not considered to be a recreational “drug” by any means and is predominantly used with the intent for healing and/or transformative purposes.</p><p><img src="./AJNAHUASCA_files/Screen_Shot_2017-07-21_at_10.14.04_PM_nq1giv.png" style="width: 90%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib" data-public_id="media/Screen_Shot_2017-07-21_at_10.14.04_PM_nq1giv" data-version="1500782581" data-signature="22645f85b4d63751ea3099519c488c7788f0b7b4" data-width="1250" data-height="832" data-format="png" data-resource_type="image" data-created_at="2017-07-23T04:03:01Z" data-tags="" data-bytes="1809037" data-type="upload" data-etag="6bc474162006f888f8ca619ee584236b" data-url="http://res.cloudinary.com/airship/image/upload/v1500782581/media/Screen_Shot_2017-07-21_at_10.14.04_PM_nq1giv.png" data-secure_url="https://res.cloudinary.com/airship/image/upload/v1500782581/media/Screen_Shot_2017-07-21_at_10.14.04_PM_nq1giv.png" data-existing="false" data-original_filename="Screen Shot 2017-07-21 at 10.14.04 PM" data-delete_token="63066083d26689e568adc199cba62659d8b8ec3ee9f8c473c036f04f121a683be8a51dd91300cecd69dfb51dee26ccef03af58b615ca60dbb67b1937d9f1074534dfe640cac5dc2ebae77b9902c932dc24b107174ecc598393c0e3400a15c237ba80d4ff0bf6d0ce3547ec0ee40f378cbe97ddf5cd65d0f6838b3a0696484012f7460ff99b370b208b80137b6d0bd14dd879803ac751ffcefa93186b5782999d"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 1994, Dr. Rick Strassman conducted a study at the University of New Mexico regarding intravenous (IV) administration of DMT to 60 human volunteers. Following the study, Dr. Strassman would write a book titled “DMT: The Spirit Molecule” based on the spiritual experiences reported by the vast majority of the subjects. There is also a documentary on Netflix and YouTube with the same title (DMT: The Spirit Molecule) in which scientists and volunteers discuss the effects of both pure DMT as well as Ayahuasca.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It is important to note that while Ayahuasca contains both DMT and monoamine oxidase inhibitors… the human body also naturally secretes a variation of these substances as well. It has been observed in <a href="https://www.docdroid.net/YaI9gtK/dmt-review.pdf.html"><span>multiple scientific studies</span></a> that humans contain 3 types of DMT (N,N-Dimethyltryptamine, 5-MEO-DMT, Bufotenine) and multiple types of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-AI’s - Pinoline, Tryptoline, Tribulin A, Harman, Neurocatin, Isoquinolium derivatives &amp; MAO-B’s - Tribulin B, Quinolic Acid, Phosphatidylserine). In essence, humans contain a biochemical soup that can be addressed as “Endohuasca” (“Endo” means endogenous or originating within the organism). There has been much speculation amongst scientists and experiencers alike that the body’s “Endohuasca” system becomes activated during altered states such as dream sleep, near-death-experiences, hypnosis/trance, meditation, sleep paralysis, Out of Body Experiences, and other non-ordinary states of consciousness.</p>

        <h1>Ajna Light</h1><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The Ajna Light is a light-based, brain wave stimulating device designed by a man named Guy Harriman. Mr. Harriman has a background in engineering working with the likes of Steve Jobs at NeXT as well as 6 years at Cisco Systems. In 2013, Guy spontaneously decided to design the initial prototype for the Ajna Light which has now morphed into what the world knows as ‘Ajna Light 3’.</p><p dir="ltr" style="text-align: justify;">The device is a gold plated and utilizes high power LED lights (5000 lumens total) to generate the light pattern. It is placed 24 to 36 inches above a person’s head if they are in lying down (altered if they prefer to sit upright). The device is then activated via a mobile phone and it can be customized to operate from a few minutes up to a few hours. Once the Ajna Light has been activated, it will generate a series of flickering patterns via the 5 lights situated on the panel. The person is to remain under the light with their eyes closed and receive the flicker pattern during the duration of the session (usually 15, 30, or 60 minutes).</p><p dir="ltr"><img src="./AJNAHUASCA_files/Screen_Shot_2017-07-22_at_9.09.10_PM_hzjxbd.png" style="width: 90%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib" data-public_id="media/Screen_Shot_2017-07-22_at_9.09.10_PM_hzjxbd" data-version="1500782968" data-signature="1da174d75a8c5a07dbc08177615fc95185c588a8" data-width="1246" data-height="934" data-format="png" data-resource_type="image" data-created_at="2017-07-23T04:09:28Z" data-tags="" data-bytes="1249158" data-type="upload" data-etag="405c9d7f04b4cf003fb895ff3dcdfdc7" data-url="http://res.cloudinary.com/airship/image/upload/v1500782968/media/Screen_Shot_2017-07-22_at_9.09.10_PM_hzjxbd.png" data-secure_url="https://res.cloudinary.com/airship/image/upload/v1500782968/media/Screen_Shot_2017-07-22_at_9.09.10_PM_hzjxbd.png" data-existing="false" data-original_filename="Screen Shot 2017-07-22 at 9.09.10 PM" data-delete_token="704bde10777dac916acff1e2243905f5033f74797828e9b500e6f45cb7a75d8d26a9336baf99a5b8ae83530d95e6474bc8f97849292ffae78cb3fd0b5afbb35c28fa529f6026cfc1ea571214509250fc62cb0e55ede96b80b384f5b1e8b9f91b10838f8cf106e24974b8a421042cb18a801c8851a9f77b94acf5345eaebe89cb88a631fcaeac0d9106a1cb6040a17c46986d40e67421927658003292ff782c9f"></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In 2015, well-known ethnopharmacologist Dr. Dennis Mckenna tried the Ajna Light and reported that after a short duration (15 minutes), he entered a state that seemed to offer recognizable similarities to that of DMT/Ayahuasca ingestion. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a region of the brain that is known as the “master oscillator” and is believed to adjust it’s activity based on circadian rhythms (light/dark cycles). During “Rapid Eye Movement” (REM) sleep (the stage in which the most vivid dreams occur), the electrophysiological activity of the SCN has been observed to elevate significantly compared to non-REM sleep stages as well as measurable increases compared to waking states as well. We speculate that the Ajna Light is having a distinct effect on the oscillations of the SCN leading to an upregulation and activation of the “Endohuasca” system. This activation then would subsequently lead to chemical release and potentially visual experiences.</p><p><img src="./AJNAHUASCA_files/Screen_Shot_2017-07-22_at_9.10.34_PM_orhw3w.png" style="width: 90%;" class="fr-fic fr-dib" data-public_id="media/Screen_Shot_2017-07-22_at_9.10.34_PM_orhw3w" data-version="1500783057" data-signature="7caeb81a93b1b621868e51d4af8b6c2210b4bce0" data-width="1300" data-height="850" data-format="png" data-resource_type="image" data-created_at="2017-07-23T04:10:57Z" data-tags="" data-bytes="474890" data-type="upload" data-etag="0a3c21fe1b48347d6a3fbf100a532039" data-url="http://res.cloudinary.com/airship/image/upload/v1500783057/media/Screen_Shot_2017-07-22_at_9.10.34_PM_orhw3w.png" data-secure_url="https://res.cloudinary.com/airship/image/upload/v1500783057/media/Screen_Shot_2017-07-22_at_9.10.34_PM_orhw3w.png" data-existing="false" data-original_filename="Screen Shot 2017-07-22 at 9.10.34 PM" data-delete_token="fecfea3f1719259901349946276ce7d4b8b7247f5919cda93f9db01b6973277330d2a4fd4089c9dd762fc269db02a0957c854fe4276120e4ddbbd1a5b4267e6046f786a2a1726751b1515b39c97b1a0e2d82b8ff0c02ef95ea3ecf513d654d04ee162c0b677999aee443a7de315f00b41ac8ed434dac2128828d3b5dea8f0348534b00f36ecf261d86be5ac2f22ffe7f41d62cc03518b5d328f83e9266f80b3e"></p><p><br></p><p style="text-align: justify;">While ongoing experimental studies will take place regarding the numerous physiological effects of the Ajna light, we believe that this device has a distinct ability to emulate different levels of the sleep-dream state while awake. Based on thousands of reports from Ajna Light users around the world claiming that the device induces states similar to that experienced during prolonged meditation and modest Ayahuasca doses... we have developed the term “Ajnahuasca” to describe the sensations.</p>
